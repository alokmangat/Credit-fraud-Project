# Credit Fraud Detection Project 👨‍💻💳

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python and Jupyter Notebook. This repository contains a notebook that performs data analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization to build an effective fraud detection system.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a major issue for financial institutions and consumers. Machine learning can help identify suspicious transactions by learning patterns from historical data. In this project, you will load a credit card transactions dataset, preprocess it, train classification models, and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics like precision, recall, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC — especially important due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraud datasets. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🛠️ Key Components

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand class imbalance, feature distributions, and transaction patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing** – Scaling and handling imbalance.
- **Machine Learning Models** – Train classifiers to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
- **Evaluation & Metrics** – Use precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alokmangat/Credit-fraud-Project.git


📈 Results

After training and evaluating models, you should be able to compare performance and draw insights on how well different algorithms detect fraud while handling imbalanced data.
